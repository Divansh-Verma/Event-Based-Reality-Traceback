# Event-Based-Reality-Traceback
An algorithm to neutralize sensor rotation and perform a velocity-compensated handshake with GAIA maps
 Project Goal: To trace back the physical reality of a square object moving at 11.42 RPM.
 The Problem: Raw event data from a rotating sensor looks like a blurry ring.
 The Solution: We developed a Velocity-Compensated Handshake algorithm. By using the derived angular velocity ($\omega \approx 1.20$ rad/s), we "de-warp" the events back into a static inertial frame.
